When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
setwd("G:\\Il mio Drive\\Research\\Book Chapter in Data Science for Economics and Finance\\Draft\\supervised-learning-firm-dynamics\\Data")
```

```{r}
load("mock_data.Rdata")
```


This simple step-by-step guide should aid the reader in designing a supervised learning (SL) routine to predict outcomes from input data.
